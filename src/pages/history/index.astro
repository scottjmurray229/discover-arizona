        <p>Most people come to Arizona for the landscapes, and I get it — the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, the red rocks of Sedona. But the history is what kept bringing me back. Standing inside a Sinagua cliff dwelling at Montezuma Castle, walking through the Copper Queen Mine in Bisbee, watching a gunfight reenactment on the streets of Tombstone — Arizona packs more history per square mile than most people expect. Every canyon and mesa has a story, and every story makes the next visit richer.</p>

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "When did Arizona become a state?", answer: "Arizona became the 48th state on February 14, 1912 — Valentine's Day. It was the last of the contiguous 48 states to be admitted to the Union. Before statehood, Arizona was a U.S. territory since 1863, and before that it was part of the New Mexico Territory, and before that part of Mexico until the Gadsden Purchase of 1853." },
    { question: "What Native American tribes are from Arizona?", answer: "Arizona is home to 22 federally recognized tribes. The largest is the Navajo Nation (Dine), spanning 27,000 square miles. The Hopi have lived on their mesas for over 1,000 years. The Tohono O'odham and Akimel O'odham (Pima) peoples have inhabited the Sonoran Desert for centuries. The Apache (including White Mountain and San Carlos) are also deeply rooted in Arizona history. Each nation has its own government, culture, and visitor policies." },
    { question: "What happened at the O.K. Corral?", answer: "The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral took place on October 26, 1881, in Tombstone, Arizona. Wyatt Earp, his brothers Virgil and Morgan, and Doc Holliday faced off against the Clanton-McLaury gang in a 30-second shootout that killed three men. The event became the most famous gunfight in American Western history. Tombstone reenacts it daily and preserves the original site as a National Historic Landmark." },
    { question: "What is the oldest settlement in Arizona?", answer: "Old Oraibi on the Hopi Third Mesa, founded around 1100 AD, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited settlements in North America. For European settlement, Tubac (established as a Spanish presidio in 1752) and Tucson (presidio established in 1775) are the oldest. The Hohokam people built extensive canal systems in the Phoenix area as early as 300 BC." },
    { question: "Why was copper so important to Arizona?", answer: "Arizona earned the nickname 'The Copper State' because it was the nation's largest copper producer for decades. Towns like Bisbee, Jerome, and Globe were built entirely around copper mining. Bisbee alone produced over 8 billion pounds of copper. The copper industry drove Arizona's economy, population growth, and path to statehood. The state capitol dome is clad in copper as a tribute." },
    { question: "Can you visit the Navajo Nation?", answer: "Yes, the Navajo Nation welcomes visitors. Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park is the most popular destination, with self-drive loops and guided tours. Many areas require a Navajo guide — especially backcountry locations with petroglyphs and ruins. Always respect tribal laws: no alcohol on the reservation, ask permission before photographing people, and stay on designated routes. The Navajo Nation observes Daylight Saving Time (unlike the rest of Arizona)." },
