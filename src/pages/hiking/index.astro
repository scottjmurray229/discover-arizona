Do not hike Camelback, Piestewa Peak, or any exposed desert trail after 9 AM in summer. Start before sunrise. Carry a minimum of 1 liter of water per hour of hiking. If you feel dizzy, nauseous, or stop sweating — stop immediately, find shade, and call 911.' },
  { label: 'Water Requirements', text: 'Carry more water than you think you need. The rule of thumb is 1 liter per hour for moderate hiking, more for strenuous trails. Electrolyte tablets or packets help replace what you lose through sweat. Dehydration sets in fast in dry desert air — you can lose a liter of sweat per hour without realizing it. There is no reliable water on most Arizona trails.' },

Lightweight long sleeves with UPF protection beat bare skin. Sunburn at 7,000 feet in Sedona happens faster than you expect.' },

A storm 20 miles away can send a wall of water through a dry canyon with zero warning. Never enter a slot canyon when rain is forecast anywhere in the region. Antelope Canyon near Page has been the site of fatal flash floods. Check weather before every hike.' },

Make noise on the trail and give wildlife space.' },

Summer is hot but manageable with early starts. <strong>Flagstaff/Grand Canyon:</strong> May through October for high-elevation trails.

Scrambling up Cathedral Rock in Sedona at sunrise, climbing Camelback Mountain while the Phoenix skyline glowed beneath me, standing on the Flat Iron summit with nothing but Superstition wilderness in every direction — Arizona has more hiking variety in one state than most regions have in an entire country.

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "What is the best hike in Arizona?", answer: "The Grand Canyon's Bright Angel Trail or South Kaibab Trail are the most iconic. For a shorter experience, Cathedral Rock in Sedona offers stunning views in under 2 hours. Camelback Mountain in Phoenix is the most popular urban hike. For a bucket-list multi-day adventure, the Grand Canyon rim-to-rim is unmatched. The 'best' depends on your fitness level, the season, and what kind of scenery you want." },
    { question: "When is the best time to hike in Arizona?", answer: "It depends on elevation. Phoenix and Tucson desert trails: October through April (avoid summer heat entirely). Sedona: year-round, with spring and fall being ideal. Grand Canyon below-rim: spring (March-May) and fall (September-November). Flagstaff and high-elevation trails: May through October. Summer monsoon season (July-September) brings afternoon thunderstorms statewide — plan to finish hikes by early afternoon." },
    { question: "How hot does it get on Arizona trails?", answer: "Phoenix desert trails can exceed 115 degrees F in summer. The Grand Canyon inner gorge reaches 110+ degrees F at river level. Sedona averages 95-100 degrees F in July-August. Flagstaff stays cooler at 80-85 degrees F in summer. Ground temperature on exposed rock can be 20-30 degrees hotter than air temperature. Heat-related rescues happen every week in summer — take it seriously." },
    { question: "Do I need a permit for Grand Canyon hiking?", answer: "Day hikes on established trails (Bright Angel, South Kaibab, Rim Trail) do not require a permit. Overnight camping below the rim requires a backcountry permit from the Grand Canyon Backcountry Information Center — apply 4 months in advance on the 1st of the month. Havasu Falls (Havasupai) requires a separate tribal permit that sells out in minutes each February." },
    { question: "What should I bring on an Arizona hike?", answer: "Minimum: 1-2 liters of water per hour, electrolyte tablets, sunscreen (SPF 50+), wide-brim hat, sturdy hiking shoes (not sandals), snacks with salt, and a fully charged phone. For longer hikes: trekking poles, first aid kit, headlamp (if starting before dawn), and a printed map — cell service is unreliable on most trails. In summer: a cooling towel and extra water beyond what you think you need." },
    { question: "Are there easy hikes in Arizona for families?", answer: "Yes. The Grand Canyon South Rim Trail is paved and mostly flat with stunning views. Bell Rock Pathway in Sedona is a gentle loop around a famous red rock formation. Valley View Overlook Trail in Saguaro National Park is under a mile through giant cactus forests. Horseshoe Bend near Page is a short 1.5-mile round-trip to one of Arizona's most photographed spots. All are family-friendly year-round (with proper sun protection)." },
