        <p>I came to Arizona expecting Tex-Mex and steakhouses. What I found was something far more interesting — a food culture shaped by centuries of Native American tradition, deep Mexican roots, and the kind of creative farm-to-table scene that happens when chefs have access to desert-grown produce no one else can get. Tucson became a UNESCO City of Gastronomy for a reason, and once you start eating your way across the state, you understand why.</p>

  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "What food is Arizona known for?", answer: "Arizona is best known for Sonoran hot dogs (bacon-wrapped with all the fixings), Navajo fry bread and Navajo tacos, chimichangas (which Arizona claims to have invented), and a rich Mexican-influenced cuisine shaped by its border with Sonora, Mexico. Tucson was designated a UNESCO City of Gastronomy in 2015 — the first city in the United States to receive the honor — for its 4,000-year agricultural heritage." },
    { question: "What is a Sonoran hot dog?", answer: "A Sonoran hot dog is a bacon-wrapped hot dog served in a bolillo-style bun and topped with pinto beans, grilled onions, fresh tomatoes, mustard, jalapeño sauce, and mayonnaise. It originated in Hermosillo, Mexico, and became a Phoenix and Tucson staple. Street carts and dedicated stands serve them across the Valley, often until late at night. Expect to pay $4-7." },
    { question: "Where is the best food in Arizona?", answer: "Tucson is the food capital — a UNESCO City of Gastronomy with deep Sonoran roots, excellent Mexican restaurants, and innovative farm-to-table dining. Phoenix has the broadest restaurant scene with everything from food trucks to James Beard-nominated chefs. Scottsdale offers upscale Southwestern fine dining. Flagstaff has a growing craft beer and pizza scene. The Navajo Nation serves some of the most culturally significant food in the state." },
    { question: "Is Arizona food spicy?", answer: "It depends on the dish. Arizona cuisine uses a range of chiles — from mild Anaheim and green chile to fiery habanero. Most restaurants offer heat levels from mild to hot. Green chile is the backbone of Arizona's Mexican food, and it adds flavor more than fire. If you're sensitive to spice, ask your server — most places are happy to adjust." },
    { question: "What is Navajo fry bread?", answer: "Navajo fry bread is a round of dough deep-fried until golden and puffy. It can be served as a dessert with honey and powdered sugar, or as the base of a Navajo taco topped with seasoned meat, beans, cheese, lettuce, and tomato. It has deep cultural significance in Navajo tradition and is found at roadside stands, chapter houses, and trading posts across the Navajo Nation." },
    { question: "How much does food cost in Arizona?", answer: "Food trucks and street food: $4-10. Casual Mexican restaurants: $10-18 per person. Mid-range restaurants: $20-40 per person. Fine dining in Scottsdale or Phoenix: $75-200+ for tasting menus. A daily food budget of $30-50 covers three solid meals comfortably. Tucson and Flagstaff tend to be slightly cheaper than Scottsdale and central Phoenix." },
