The Sanctuary Spa has indoor-outdoor treatment rooms with desert mountain views, an infinity-edge pool that seems to float above Paradise Valley, and a meditation garden that\'s worth the visit alone. Rooms start at $500/night in peak season (January–April), dropping to $250–350 in summer. The restaurant, Elements, is one of the best in the state — contemporary American with a terrace overlooking the valley. Entrees $35–65.' },

The Centre for Well-Being spa offers everything from hot stone massages to desert-inspired body wraps using native botanicals. The 27-hole golf course is championship-caliber, and the pool complex rivals anything in Vegas. Rooms $400–900/night in peak season. Six restaurants on property, including Il Terrazzo for Italian and J&G Steakhouse by Jean-Georges Vongerichten. This is where old-money Scottsdale comes to play.' },

The lodge-style cottages have fireplaces and private decks overlooking the water. The spa specializes in outdoor treatments — imagine a massage on a deck above the creek with red rocks towering above you. Rooms $400–800/night. The restaurant, Cress on Oak Creek, is fine dining with creek views — locally sourced elk, trout, and produce from Arizona farms. Entrees $40–70. The stargazing program with the resort\'s resident astronomer is a must.' },

Hearth \'61 restaurant does elevated comfort food — their wagyu burger is famous locally. More relaxed and design-forward than the grand resorts, attracting a younger luxury crowd.' },

Flights launch at dawn (5:30–6am depending on season) and last 60–90 minutes. $200–350/person with most operators, including a champagne toast and breakfast upon landing. Hot Air Expeditions and Rainbow Ryders are the most established operators. Book at least 2 weeks ahead in peak season (October–April). Weather cancellations are rare in Arizona, but wind can delay launches.' },

Tours from the South Rim run $250–400/person for 25–50 minutes. The premium option is a West Rim tour from Las Vegas that lands on the canyon floor ($400–600/person). Maverick Helicopters and Papillon are the top operators. The South Rim routes fly over the Dragon Corridor — the widest, deepest section of the canyon. Even if you\'ve stood on the rim a dozen times, seeing it from above rewrites your sense of scale.' },

Tours run $150–350/person for 15–45 minutes. Guidance Air and Arizona Helicopter Adventures operate from Sedona Airport. The longer tours reach the rim of the Mogollon Rim and the ancient cliff dwellings at Palatki. The red-on-green contrast from above — red sandstone against juniper forests — is stunning in person.' },

Skydive Arizona in Eloy (between Phoenix and Tucson) is one of the largest drop zones in the world — serious skydivers train here year-round. Tandem jumps start at $200–300/person with a 60-second freefall from 12,000 feet.

A 15–20 course tasting menu ($185–250/person) that changes weekly based on what\'s available from local farms and Binkley\'s own garden. Wine pairing adds $125.

Entrees $30–55. The building is a converted church, which gives it an atmosphere that most restaurants can\'t manufacture. The weekend brunch is popular and the margarita program is arguably the best in Phoenix. Not stuffy — this is the kind of place where you dress up but still have fun.' },

Four-course dinner $95–125/person. The menu rotates weekly — expect dishes like seared foie gras, pan-roasted duck breast with seasonal fruit reduction, and housemade desserts that are worth the calories. The wine list is curated and personal, and the chef will often come to your table. Intimate, personal, and consistently excellent. Reserve a week ahead.' },

The wait is typically 45–90 minutes in peak season, but the bar serves full cocktails and the patio has red rock views. Worth every minute of the wait.' },

The Stadium Course is a desert links masterpiece with the famous 16th hole (the "Coliseum"). Green fees $150–350 depending on season. In January–February, rates peak and tee times are scarce. Summer green fees drop to $50–100, but you\'ll be playing in 110°F heat — which is honestly fine if you hydrate, take a cart, and embrace the empty course. The Champions Course next door is less famous but equally playable.' },

The Monument and Pinnacle courses are both ranked among the top public courses in Arizona — dramatic elevation changes, boulder-lined fairways, and views of Pinnacle Peak. Green fees $175–325 in peak season, $75–150 in summer. The Monument Course\'s signature holes use massive granite boulders as natural hazards. Arguably the most scenic golf in the Phoenix metro area.' },

Green fees $100–200 depending on season and time of day. The course is well-maintained and the elevation changes add strategic interest. Not the most challenging course in Arizona, but easily the most visually stunning. Tee off early morning for the best light on the rocks and cooler temperatures. The clubhouse restaurant has solid food and panoramic views.' },
      { label: 'We-Ko-Pa Golf Club (Fort McDowell)', text: 'Two courses on the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation — Saguaro and Cholla — both designed by different architects with distinct personalities. Saguaro is the target-golf desert classic; Cholla is wider and more forgiving but equally scenic. Green fees $100–225. The setting is dramatic — surrounded by the Superstition Mountains and Four Peaks with minimal housing development. This is pure desert golf without the real estate distractions. Consistently rated among Arizona\'s best public courses.' },

The Syrah and Grenache varietals thrive in the high desert climate. It\'s Napa 30 years ago — small producers, no pretension, and prices that haven\'t caught up to the quality yet.' },

Private guided vortex tours with certified practitioners run $150–300/person for 2–3 hours — they combine the hike with meditation, energy work, and interpretive geology.

The high-desert terroir — elevation, temperature swings, and volcanic soil — produces surprisingly complex wines. Syrah, Grenache, Mourvèdre, and Malvasia are the standout varietals. The tasting room scene is concentrated in three areas: Cottonwood\'s Old Town, Page Springs/Cornville along Oak Creek, and the old mining town of Jerome on Cleopatra Hill. A full wine tasting day can hit 8–10 rooms without driving more than 20 miles.' },
      { label: 'Page Springs Cellars', text: 'The winery that put Arizona on the wine map — Eric Glomski was making serious wine here before anyone paid attention. The tasting room sits on Oak Creek with outdoor seating under cottonwood trees. Their Colibri (a Rhone-style red blend) and El Serrano Syrah are standouts. Tastings $15–20. The creek-side setting is beautiful and the vibe is relaxed — no appointment needed, though weekends get crowded after 2pm. This is where Arizona wine lovers start.' },

Known for their "Leap" wines and a playful approach — the javelina (wild peccary) theme runs throughout. Tastings $12–18. The barrel room tour ($25) is worth it for the winemaking insights. Their rosé is one of the best in the state. Smaller and more personal than Page Springs Cellars — you might end up chatting with the winemaker.' },
      { label: 'Alcantara Vineyards', text: 'The most polished tasting room in the Verde Valley — a Tuscan-inspired estate with manicured grounds, bocce courts, and a swimming hole on the Verde River. Their Sangiovese and Petite Sirah are excellent. Tastings $18–25. They offer food pairings and vineyard tours that go deeper into the agricultural side. The setting feels transplanted from Tuscany — stone walls, cypress trees, and mountain views. Book a table for a leisurely lunch and tasting.' },
      { label: 'Jerome Wine Trail', text: 'The former copper mining town of Jerome — clinging to the side of Cleopatra Hill at 5,000 feet — has reinvented itself with art galleries, restaurants, and tasting rooms. Caduceus Cellars (Maynard James Keenan of Tool fame), Arizona Stronghold, and Passion Cellars all have tasting rooms within walking distance. The town itself is the attraction — Victorian buildings, mine shafts, and views stretching 50 miles across the valley. Combine wine tasting with the Jerome ghost tour for a full afternoon.' },

        <p>Arizona surprised me. I came for the Grand Canyon and the desert landscapes, and I found a luxury travel destination that rivals anywhere in the country. Scottsdale's spa resorts are world-class without being pretentious. The dining scene stretches from a Five Diamond Native American restaurant on tribal land to a no-reservations Mexican joint in Sedona that people line up for nightly. The wine country in Verde Valley is what Napa was decades ago — small producers making serious wine at honest prices. And floating over the desert in a hot air balloon at sunrise, with nothing but saguaros and mountains below you, is one of those experiences that rewires your definition of luxury.</p>

      <div class="ft-protips-card">
        <h2 class="ft-protips-heading">Scott's Pro Tips</h2>
        <div class="scott-tips">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Summer Deals:</strong> Arizona luxury is a tale of two seasons. Peak season (October–April) commands premium rates, but summer (May–September) slashes prices 40–60% at the same resorts. A $600/night Scottsdale resort drops to $200. Yes, it's 110°F outside, but you're at a pool and spa — the heat becomes the bargain.</li>
            <li><strong>Balloon Timing:</strong> Hot air balloon rides launch at dawn year-round. In summer, that means a 5am pickup but you're done before the heat hits. In winter, the 6:30am launch is more civilized. Either way, bring a light jacket — it's cooler at altitude than on the ground, especially in the morning desert air.</li>
            <li><strong>Wine Country Strategy:</strong> Start in Cottonwood's Old Town for walkable tasting rooms, then drive to Page Springs for creek-side wineries, and finish in Jerome for sunset views. Designate a driver or book a wine tour shuttle ($75–150/person). Don't try to hit more than 5–6 rooms — palate fatigue is real.</li>
            <li><strong>Golf in Summer:</strong> Twilight tee times (after 2pm in summer) are a fraction of peak-season rates. TPC Scottsdale drops to $50–75, Troon North to $75–100. Carry extra water, wear a hat, and take the cart. The course is empty and the sunset light on the desert is spectacular.</li>
            <li><strong>Sedona Dining:</strong> Elote Cafe doesn't take reservations — get there by 4:30pm to get your name on the list, then walk to the nearby shops or grab a cocktail while you wait. The 45–90 minute wait is part of the Sedona experience, and the food justifies it every time.</li>
            <li><strong>Resort Day Passes:</strong> Several Scottsdale resorts offer day passes for non-guests — pool, spa, and dining access for $50–150/person. It's a smart way to experience multiple properties without committing to a full stay at each one.</li>
