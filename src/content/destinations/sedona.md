From Flagstaff, it's a stunning 30-mile drive south through Oak Creek Canyon on AZ-89A — one of the most scenic drives in America. The nearest commercial airport is Flagstaff Pulliam (FLG), 45 minutes north, though most visitors fly into Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX)."

The first time I drove into Sedona from the south on AZ-179, I pulled over three times in the first ten minutes just to stare. The red rock formations rise from the desert floor like massive sandstone cathedrals, glowing in shades of crimson, rust, and burnt orange that shift with every passing cloud. I've been to a lot of beautiful places, but Sedona occupies its own category. There's something about the interplay of red rock against blue sky that feels almost otherworldly.

Sedona sits at about 4,350 feet in the Verde Valley, which gives it a milder climate than the low desert around Phoenix and a more dramatic landscape than just about anywhere else in the state. It's become a destination for hikers, artists, spiritual seekers, and anyone who just wants to be surrounded by stunning natural beauty. And despite its reputation as a tourist town, it's remarkably easy to find solitude once you get a quarter-mile down any trail.

## What Makes Sedona Special

The red rocks are the headliner, but what makes Sedona truly special is the sheer density of experiences packed into a small area. Within a 15-minute drive from the center of town, you can access world-class hiking, ancient Native American ruins, acclaimed restaurants, over 80 art galleries, and some of the most photographed landscapes in the American West.

The geology is genuinely remarkable. Those red formations — Cathedral Rock, Bell Rock, Courthouse Butte, Bear Mountain — are Permian-era sandstone colored by iron oxide, roughly 300 million years old. The contrast between the red stone, the dark green juniper and cypress forests, and the deep blue sky creates a color palette that artists have been trying to capture for over a century.

Then there are the vortex sites. Sedona has four primary vortex locations — Airport Mesa, Cathedral Rock, Bell Rock, and Boynton Canyon — where many visitors report feeling a palpable energy or heightened sense of awareness. Whether you're a believer or a skeptic, these sites happen to coincide with some of the best viewpoints in town, so the hike is worthwhile regardless.

## Things to Do

**Cathedral Rock Trail** is the signature Sedona hike — a steep 1.2-mile scramble up slickrock that rewards you with 360-degree views of the entire red rock landscape. It's short but intense, with some sections requiring hands-on scrambling. Get there before 7 AM to beat the crowds and catch the morning light. Free with a Red Rock Pass ($5/day) at the trailhead parking.

**Devil's Bridge Trail** leads to the largest natural sandstone arch in the area, and the photo from the bridge itself has become one of Arizona's most iconic images. The trail is about 4 miles round trip from the main parking area, or 2 miles if you access it via the Dry Creek Road trailhead (high-clearance vehicle recommended). The bridge itself is broad and sturdy but exposed — not ideal if you have a fear of heights.

**Bell Rock Pathway** is a flat, easy trail perfect for families, circling the base of the distinctive bell-shaped formation. The paved path is about 3.6 miles, but you can extend it by scrambling up the lower slopes of Bell Rock itself. Parking is along AZ-179 at the Bell Rock Vista.

**Boynton Canyon Trail** is a 6.1-mile round trip hike that takes you deep into one of Sedona's most beautiful box canyons. The trailhead also accesses the Boynton Canyon Vortex site about a quarter-mile in. This one stays cooler in summer thanks to the canyon shade.

**Pink Jeep Tours** are a Sedona institution. The Broken Arrow tour ($110-130 per person for about two hours) is the most popular, bouncing over rugged terrain past Submarine Rock and the Chapel of the Holy Cross area. The guides are knowledgeable and entertaining, and the off-road access takes you places you simply can't reach on foot or in a regular vehicle.

**Tlaquepaque Arts & Shopping Village** is styled after a traditional Mexican village, with vine-covered stucco walls, cobblestone walkways, and over 50 galleries and boutiques. It's touristy, absolutely, but the craftsmanship on display is legitimate. I always stop at Kuivato Glass Gallery to watch the live glassblowing demonstrations. Free to wander.

**Slide Rock State Park**, about 7 miles north of town in Oak Creek Canyon, is a natural water park where you can slide down a smooth sandstone creek bed into swimming holes. Entry is $20-30 per vehicle depending on season. Go on a weekday in summer to avoid the worst crowds.

**Chapel of the Holy Cross** is a striking modernist chapel built into the red rock buttes south of town. Designed by sculptor and architect Marguerite Brunswig Staude and completed in 1956, it offers incredible views and a moment of quiet reflection. Free admission; open daily 9 AM to 5 PM.

## Where to Stay

**Enchantment Resort** in Boynton Canyon is the top luxury option, set dramatically at the base of towering red rock walls. Rooms start around $400 per night in peak season, and the Mii Amo spa on the property is consistently ranked among the best in the country. The setting alone is worth a splurge.

**L'Auberge de Sedona** sits along Oak Creek in the heart of town, with creekside cottages starting around $350-500 per night. The on-site restaurant, Etch Kitchen & Bar, is one of the best in Sedona. Request a creekside room — falling asleep to the sound of the creek is a luxury money can buy.

**Arabella Hotel Sedona** offers stylish mid-range rooms starting around $180-250, with a pool, fire pits, and views of the surrounding red rocks. Great location in the Uptown area, walking distance to shops and restaurants.

**Sky Ranch Lodge** sits atop Airport Mesa with some of the best panoramic views of any hotel in Sedona. Rooms run $130-200 per night, making it the best value-for-views ratio in town.

For budget travelers, **Rancho Sedona RV Park** has tent sites from $45 per night right along Oak Creek, and the **Sedona Village Lodge** in the Village of Oak Creek offers basic clean rooms from about $90.

## Where to Eat

**Elote Cafe** is the restaurant that put Sedona on the culinary map. Chef Jeff Smedstad's menu focuses on Mexican-inspired dishes — the fire-roasted elote (street corn) and smoked brisket enchiladas are legendary. Entrees run $18-35. No reservations; put your name in starting at 4:30 PM and expect a wait, especially on weekends. It's worth every minute.

**Mariposa Latin Inspired Grill** offers stunning red rock views from its hillside patio and an upscale Latin American menu. Entrees run $30-55. The tableside guacamole and lamb chops are standouts. Make reservations well in advance.

**The Hudson** serves creative American cuisine in a relaxed setting along AZ-89A. I love their happy hour ($8-12 small plates) on the patio. Dinner entrees run $22-40.

**Creekside Coffee** in Uptown Sedona is my go-to morning stop — great espresso drinks ($4-7) with a small patio overlooking Oak Creek. Pair it with one of their pastries for a solid start to a hiking day.

**Hideaway House** has been serving pizza and Italian dishes since 1973, with red rock views from the back patio that rival any fine-dining spot. Pizzas run $14-20. Casual, reliable, and consistently good.

**Tamaliza** is a small counter-service spot near the Y roundabout with some of the best handmade tamales I've had in Arizona. A plate of three tamales with all the fixings runs about $12-15. Perfect quick lunch fuel between hikes.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Logistics & Getting There** — I always take AZ-179 from I-17 for the approach from Phoenix. The scenic views start rolling in about 20 minutes before you hit town, and it puts you right at the Bell Rock trailheads. From Flagstaff, the Oak Creek Canyon drive on AZ-89A is spectacular but has tight switchbacks — take it slow and enjoy the overlooks.

**Best Time to Visit** — March, April, October, and November are the sweet spots: warm days, cool nights, manageable crowds. Summer temps hit the mid-to-upper 90s, which makes midday hiking miserable. Winter is beautiful but expect nighttime temps in the 30s and occasional snow on the higher trails.

**Getting Around** — You need a car. Sedona is spread out, and the trailheads are scattered across a wide area. Parking at popular spots like Cathedral Rock and Devil's Bridge fills by 8-9 AM on weekends. The Sedona Shuttle (free on some routes) is expanding but still limited. An alternative: park at the Posse Grounds hub and use the shuttle to reach trailheads.

**Money & ATMs** — There are ATMs at the National Bank of Arizona in Uptown and at various banks along AZ-89A. Most businesses accept credit cards. Budget about $5 per day for the Red Rock Pass (required at most Coconino National Forest trailheads) or buy a weekly pass for $15.

**Safety & Health** — The biggest hazards are dehydration and slippery slickrock. Carry at least two liters of water per hike, even on shorter trails. Watch your footing on smooth sandstone — it's extremely slippery when wet. Rattlesnakes are present but rarely seen on busy trails. The nearest hospital is Verde Valley Medical Center in Cottonwood, about 20 minutes southwest.

**Packing Essentials** — Hiking shoes with good grip are non-negotiable for the slickrock trails. Bring a sun hat, high-SPF sunscreen, and layers for morning and evening temperature swings. A headlamp is useful for early-morning hikes to catch sunrise from the summits.

**Local Culture & Etiquette** — Sedona's vortex sites are meaningful to many visitors, so be respectful even if it's not your thing. Don't stack rocks or leave crystals at vortex sites — it's considered littering and damages the environment. Stay on marked trails to protect the fragile biological soil crust (the dark, bumpy ground cover). Tip your jeep tour guides ($10-20 per person is standard).
