Scottsdale has a reputation as a playground for the wealthy — and that reputation isn't entirely unearned. This is a city of world-class resorts, $400-a-round golf courses, and restaurants where a steak dinner can run into triple digits. But what I've found across several visits is that Scottsdale is considerably more layered than the luxury veneer suggests. Behind the spa culture and resort pools, there's an authentic western heritage, a desert preserve system that rivals any in the state, and a creative food and art scene that stands on its own merits.

Old Town Scottsdale is where the city's split personality is most visible. Western-themed saloons and leather shops sit next to contemporary art galleries and craft cocktail bars. On a Saturday afternoon, you'll see tourists in cowboy hats posing with the bronze horse statues on Main Street, right alongside locals shopping for gallery art and heading to brunch. It's a little bit of everything, and it works.

## What Makes Scottsdale Special

Scottsdale's greatest asset might be the McDowell Sonoran Preserve — 30,580 acres of protected Sonoran Desert wilderness with over 225 miles of trails, all within the city limits. It's the largest urban preserve in the United States, and the fact that a city known for luxury resorts also fiercely protects its desert wilderness speaks volumes about Scottsdale's character.

The arts scene is genuinely impressive. The Scottsdale Arts District along Marshall Way and Main Street contains more than 100 galleries, making it one of the largest art markets in the country. Thursday evening ArtWalks (7-9 PM, free) are a Scottsdale institution that draw serious collectors alongside casual browsers.

Then there's the resort culture. Scottsdale has one of the highest concentrations of destination spas and luxury resorts in North America. Places like the Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain, the Phoenician, and Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North set a standard that few cities can match.

And from mid-February through March, Cactus League spring training transforms the city into baseball's unofficial capital, with 15 Major League teams playing across the greater Phoenix metro area.

## Things to Do

**Old Town Scottsdale** is the walkable historic core, stretching roughly from Scottsdale Road to Goldwater Boulevard between Indian School Road and Second Street. The western side has art galleries and jewelry shops; the eastern side has restaurants, bars, and nightlife. Stop by the Scottsdale Museum of the West ($15 admission) for a well-curated look at western American art and history. The bronze sculptures along Main Street are free to admire. Plan 2-3 hours to explore properly.

**McDowell Sonoran Preserve** is the crown jewel of Scottsdale's outdoor scene. The Gateway Trailhead is the main access point, with excellent facilities and ranger programs. I recommend the Windgate Pass Trail (5.2 miles round trip) for a challenging hike to a ridgeline with sweeping views of the McDowell Mountains and the city below. The Tom's Thumb Trail (4.4 miles round trip) is another standout, ending at a dramatic granite pinnacle. Free; trailhead parking requires a reservation during peak season via the McDowell Sonoran Conservancy website.

**TPC Scottsdale** hosts the WM Phoenix Open every February — the best-attended tournament in professional golf, drawing over 700,000 spectators for the week. The Stadium Course is open to public play at other times, with green fees running $100-275 depending on season. The Champions Course is the more affordable option at $50-100.

**Scottsdale Waterfront** is a pleasant shopping and dining district along the Arizona Canal, connecting to Old Town and the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall (one of the largest in the Southwest, with Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, and over 200 stores). The canal path is nice for an evening stroll.

**Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West** is Wright's winter home and architectural school, set dramatically against the McDowell Mountains in north Scottsdale. Guided tours ($40-75 depending on tour type) take you through the drafting studio, garden room, and private quarters. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site and essential for anyone interested in architecture or design. Reservations required.

**Butterfly Wonderland** near the Scottsdale Aquarium is the largest butterfly conservatory in America, with thousands of butterflies in a tropical rainforest atrium. It's a great family-friendly activity, especially in summer when it's too hot for outdoor activities. Admission is $28 for adults.

**Cactus League Spring Training** runs mid-February through late March, with games at Scottsdale Stadium (San Francisco Giants), Salt River Fields at Talking Stick (Arizona Diamondbacks and Colorado Rockies), and other venues around the valley. Tickets run $15-60 depending on seating. The atmosphere is relaxed and festive — grab a beer, sit in the outfield grass, and watch baseball in perfect weather.

## Where to Stay

**Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain** is an intimate luxury resort tucked into the north slope of Camelback Mountain, with casita-style rooms starting around $500-800 per night in peak season. The infinity-edge pool overlooking Paradise Valley is one of the most photographed hotel amenities in Arizona. The on-site elements restaurant is excellent.

**The Phoenician** is Scottsdale's grand resort, sprawling across 250 acres at the base of Camelback Mountain. Rooms start around $400-700, and the property includes a 2-acre cactus garden, an athletic club, and multiple pools. Recently renovated, it feels both classic and contemporary.

**Hotel Valley Ho** is a mid-century modern gem in the heart of Old Town, with rooms from $200-350 per night. The pool scene is lively, the design is impeccable, and you can walk to everything in Old Town. This is my personal pick for the best balance of style, location, and value.

**The Saguaro Scottsdale** brings a colorful, playful vibe with rooms from $150-250 per night. The multicolored exterior is an Instagram favorite, and the pool area is festive without being over-the-top. Good location near Old Town.

**Bespoke Inn Scottsdale** is a small boutique hotel with just four rooms starting around $250 per night. Each room is individually designed, and the attached Virtu restaurant is one of Scottsdale's best. For couples looking for something intimate, this is hard to beat.

For budget travelers, **Extended Stay America** and **Motel 6 Scottsdale** offer functional rooms from $60-90 per night, though they lack the character of the boutique options.

## Where to Eat

**FnB Restaurant** on North Scottsdale Road is chef Charleen Badman's vegetable-forward gem, and it's my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. The wood-roasted vegetables are transcendent — genuinely some of the best vegetable cookery I've encountered. The wine list is natural-leaning and excellent. Dishes run $16-35. Reservations essential.

**Citizen Public House** serves a menu that ranges from sushi-grade hamachi crudo to a monster wagyu burger. The Gentleman's Breakfast (slow-cooked pork belly, eggs, grits, biscuits) at brunch is worth planning your morning around. Dishes run $18-40. Great cocktail program.

**The Mission** in Old Town serves Latin-inspired cuisine in a gorgeous Spanish Colonial space with a dramatic stone fireplace. The tableside guacamole is a must-start, and the braised short rib with mole negro is outstanding. Entrees run $22-45. Reservations recommended.

**Diego Pops** is a colorful, casual spot in Old Town serving modern Mexican street food. Tacos ($4-6 each), excellent margaritas ($12), and a fun patio scene. Perfect for a quick, affordable lunch between gallery visits.

**Hash Kitchen** is the city's most popular brunch spot, known for its build-your-own Bloody Mary bar with over 40 ingredients. The chicken and waffles and cinnamon roll pancakes are as over-the-top as they sound. Brunch dishes run $14-22. Weekend waits can exceed an hour — go early.

**Hula's Modern Tiki** in the Arts District serves creative Pacific Rim cuisine alongside tropical cocktails. The poke bowls ($16) and coconut shrimp ($15) are reliably good, and the tiki bar atmosphere is genuinely fun without being cheesy.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Logistics & Getting There** — Fly into Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) and take a rideshare to Scottsdale — it's about $15-25 depending on where in Scottsdale you're heading. If you're combining Scottsdale with a Sedona or Grand Canyon trip, rent a car; otherwise, rideshares and the free Scottsdale Trolley can handle most tourist needs within Old Town.

**Best Time to Visit** — November through March is the prime season with perfect 65-80°F weather, but also peak pricing. The WM Phoenix Open in February and spring training in February-March are the busiest and most expensive periods. For the best value with great weather, try early November or late March. Summer is scorching (110°F-plus) but resort rates plummet — if you can stay poolside, it's a legitimate budget play.

**Getting Around** — The free Scottsdale Trolley runs through Old Town, the Waterfront, and the Arts District. Beyond that, rideshares are the most practical option. The McDowell Sonoran Preserve trailheads require a vehicle. Scottsdale is not a walking city outside of Old Town — distances between areas are significant.

**Money & ATMs** — ATMs are plentiful at Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America branches throughout the city. Scottsdale is pricier than Phoenix — expect to spend 20-30% more on dining and accommodation. Resort fees ($30-50/night) are common at larger hotels, so factor those into your budget.

**Safety & Health** — Scottsdale is generally very safe. The main risks are sun-related: heat exhaustion, sunburn, and dehydration. Always carry water on hikes. For the nightlife-oriented Entertainment District on weekends, use rideshares rather than driving — DUI enforcement is aggressive in Arizona. Scottsdale HonorHealth Osborn Medical Center is the closest hospital to Old Town.

**Packing Essentials** — Bring resort-casual clothing if you plan on dining at upscale restaurants — collared shirts and closed-toe shoes are appreciated though rarely required. Hiking shoes for the preserve, swimwear for the resort pools, sunscreen and a hat for everything else. If you're visiting for nightlife, Scottsdale's bars and clubs are dressier than the rest of the valley.

**Local Culture & Etiquette** — Scottsdale has a distinct identity from Phoenix — locals take the distinction seriously, so don't call it "part of Phoenix." The Thursday ArtWalk (7-9 PM) is a community tradition, not just a tourist event — show up, support local artists, and engage. Tipping 18-20% is standard. At resorts, tip valet ($3-5), bellhops ($2-5/bag), and housekeeping ($3-5/night).
