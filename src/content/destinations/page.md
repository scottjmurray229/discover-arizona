I will be honest: I expected Page to be nothing more than a pit stop. A small town built in the 1950s to house dam workers, tucked into the desert near the Utah border. But within an hour of arriving, I understood why photographers and adventurers keep coming back. The landscape around Page is almost aggressively beautiful — carved sandstone in every shade of orange and red, a massive reservoir of impossibly blue water, and geological features so dramatic they look digitally enhanced. Page may not have the polish of Sedona or the name recognition of the Grand Canyon, but what it delivers in raw visual impact is unmatched.

## What Makes Page Special

Page sits at the center of a geological showcase that took millions of years to create. Within a 15-mile radius of town, you can walk through slot canyons so narrow you can touch both walls, stand on the rim of a 1,000-foot horseshoe-shaped cliff, cruise across one of America's largest reservoirs, and visit an engineering marvel that reshaped the entire Colorado River system. The concentration of world-class natural attractions in such a small area is staggering.

What also sets Page apart is the involvement of the Navajo Nation. Upper and Lower Antelope Canyon both sit on Navajo land and can only be visited with authorized Navajo tour guides. This adds a cultural dimension that elevates the experience beyond simple sightseeing — the guides share stories about the formations, the history of their people, and the spiritual significance of these places.

## Things to Do

**Upper Antelope Canyon** is the one you have seen in a thousand photographs — soaring sandstone walls with shafts of light pouring down from above during midday. Tours are operated by several authorized Navajo companies including Adventurous Antelope Canyon Tours and Antelope Canyon Navajo Tours. Standard tours run about $60 per person and last approximately 1.5 hours. Photographer tours with longer access and tripod permissions cost $100+. Book well in advance, especially for the 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM time slots when the light beams are strongest (late March through early October).

**Lower Antelope Canyon** is narrower, deeper, and requires climbing ladders and squeezing through tight passages. I actually preferred it — fewer crowds and equally stunning formations. Ken's Tours and Dixie Ellis' Lower Antelope Canyon Tours are the main operators. Expect to pay $40–$55 per person.

**Horseshoe Bend** is a 1.5-mile round trip walk from the parking lot on US-89 to an overlook where the Colorado River makes a dramatic 270-degree turn around a sandstone mesa, 1,000 feet below. The parking fee is $10 per vehicle. Go at sunrise or sunset for the best light and smaller crowds. There are railings now, but the exposure is still intense — keep a firm grip on cameras and children.

**Lake Powell** is a 186-mile-long reservoir with 1,960 miles of shoreline, more than the entire Pacific coast of the United States. Wahweap Marina, just 5 miles from town, rents powerboats, kayaks, and paddleboards. A half-day powerboat rental starts around $400. Guided boat tours to Rainbow Bridge National Monument, the world's largest natural bridge at 290 feet tall, run approximately $130–$180 per person for a full-day trip.

**Glen Canyon Dam** is a 710-foot concrete arch dam that created Lake Powell when it was completed in 1966. The Carl Hayden Visitor Center at the dam is free to enter and offers excellent exhibits on the dam's construction and the ecology of the Colorado River. Guided dam tours (when available) take you inside the structure for about $5 per person.

**Wahweap Overlook and Chains Area** offer free and uncrowded desert hiking with sweeping views of Lake Powell's hoodoos and coves. These are not marked trails, so bring GPS and plenty of water.

## Where to Stay

**Budget travelers** should check out the Debbie's Hideaway hostel or look into camping at Wahweap Campground near the marina, where tent sites start around $26 per night with lake views. The Lone Rock Beach primitive camping area on the Utah side is free with some seasonal restrictions.

**Mid-range visitors** will find consistent quality at the Hyatt Place Page Lake Powell, where rooms run $130–$180 and include breakfast. The Best Western View of Lake Powell, on the hill above town, offers solid rooms with panoramic views for $120–$170.

**Luxury seekers** have fewer options in Page itself, but the Amangiri resort is just 25 miles away across the Utah border near Canyon Point. Rooms start around $2,500 a night, but if your budget allows, it is one of the most stunning luxury properties in the American West. In Page proper, the Lake Powell Resort at Wahweap Marina has lakefront rooms starting around $250 in shoulder season.

## Where to Eat

**Big John's Texas BBQ** on North Navajo Drive is a Page institution. The brisket and pulled pork are smoked on-site, portions are enormous, and the sweet tea is dangerously good. Plates run $14–$22.

**El Tapatio** on South Lake Powell Boulevard serves reliable Mexican food with generous portions. The carne asada tacos and green chile burrito are my go-to orders. Meals run $10–$16.

**Bonkers Restaurant** downtown is the closest thing Page has to fine dining. The steaks and seafood are well-prepared, and the wine list is decent for a town this size. Entrees run $22–$38.

**Blue Buddha Sushi Lounge** on North Navajo Drive is an unexpected find. The sushi is surprisingly fresh given that you are in the middle of the desert, and the atmosphere is lively. Rolls run $12–$18.

**Ranch House Grille** on South Lake Powell Boulevard does a proper American breakfast — eggs, bacon, pancakes, and strong coffee. It gets packed on weekend mornings, so arrive early. Breakfast runs $10–$15.

**Slackers** on North Navajo Drive is a casual burger-and-beer spot that is perfect after a long day of hiking. The Slacker Burger with green chile is the move. Burgers run $12–$16.

### Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** Most visitors drive. From Flagstaff, it is 2.5 hours north on US-89. From Phoenix, take I-17 north to Flagstaff, then US-89 north — about 4.5 hours total. From the Grand Canyon South Rim via the East Entrance and US-89, it is about 2.5 hours. Page Municipal Airport (PGA) has limited flights.

**Best Time to Visit:** Spring (March through May) and fall (October) offer mild temperatures in the 60s and 70s and manageable crowds. Summer is brutally hot, often exceeding 100 degrees, and Antelope Canyon tours sell out months ahead. The famous light beams in Upper Antelope Canyon are best from late March through early October around midday.

**Getting Around:** You need a car in Page. The town is spread out and all the major attractions are several miles apart. There is no public transit or rideshare service to speak of.

**Money & ATMs:** Wells Fargo and National Bank of Arizona have ATMs in town. Credit cards are accepted at most businesses, but carry cash for tips on Navajo-guided tours.

**Safety & Health:** Slot canyons are flash flood zones. Tours will be cancelled if there is any rain in the forecast — do not attempt to enter slot canyons independently. Dehydration is a serious risk from May through September. The nearest hospital is Page Hospital on North Navajo Drive.

**Packing Essentials:** Bring a wide-angle lens for the slot canyons, sturdy shoes with good grip for the ladder sections in Lower Antelope Canyon, and a minimum of two liters of water per person for any outdoor activity. Sunscreen and a hat are non-negotiable. A polarizing filter for your camera helps manage reflections at Horseshoe Bend.

**Local Culture & Etiquette:** Antelope Canyon and much of the surrounding land is Navajo Nation territory. Always respect your guide's instructions, stay with the group, and do not touch or deface the canyon walls. Photography rules vary by tour operator — confirm in advance whether tripods and drones are permitted (most tours prohibit both). Tipping your Navajo guide $5–$10 per person is customary and appreciated.
