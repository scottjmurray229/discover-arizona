I almost skipped Petrified Forest National Park. On the map it looked like a quick detour off I-40 — maybe an hour, maybe two, somewhere between Flagstaff and Albuquerque. I figured I would see some old logs, snap a few photos, and move on. I ended up staying until the ranger kicked me out at sunset. This is one of those places that rewards patience and attention. The longer you look, the more you see: logs that shimmer with quartz crystals in red, yellow, and purple; badlands that shift color with every passing cloud; petroglyphs scratched into dark desert varnish by people who lived here a thousand years ago. Petrified Forest is not flashy, but it is profoundly strange and deeply beautiful.

## What Makes Petrified Forest Special

The park protects one of the largest concentrations of petrified wood on Earth. These are not just old trees — they are trees from the Late Triassic period, roughly 225 million years ago, when this part of Arizona was a lush tropical floodplain near the equator. Over millennia, fallen logs were buried under volcanic ash and sediment. Silica-rich groundwater seeped in, replacing the organic material cell by cell with quartz, jasper, and agate. The result is wood that has become gemstone, with colors so vivid they look hand-painted.

But petrified wood is only half the story. The northern section of the park encompasses a sweeping stretch of the Painted Desert, where eroded badlands display layers of siltstone and mudstone in reds, purples, grays, and whites. The park also contains over 600 archaeological sites, including petroglyphs, pueblo ruins, and evidence of human habitation stretching back over 13,000 years.

## Things to Do

**The Park Road** runs 28 miles from the north entrance (off I-40) to the south entrance (off US-180), with more than 15 pullouts, overlooks, and short trails along the way. You can drive the entire road in under an hour, but plan for at least three to four hours to actually see the park.

**Crystal Forest Trail** is a 0.75-mile paved loop through one of the densest concentrations of petrified wood in the park. Logs are scattered everywhere, many of them broken open to reveal cross-sections of amethyst, citrine, and smoky quartz crystal. The colors in late afternoon light are extraordinary.

**Blue Mesa Trail** is a one-mile loop that descends into a landscape of blue, purple, and gray banded badlands. The striped mesas and pedestal logs — petrified wood balanced atop eroding pedestals of clay — make this one of the most photographed spots in the park. The trail drops about 160 feet, so the climb back out is moderate but noticeable.

**Newspaper Rock** is a large boulder covered with over 650 petroglyphs carved by ancestral Puebloan people between 650 and 2,000 years ago. Bring binoculars — the rock is viewable from an overlook about 100 yards away. You can pick out human figures, animals, geometric designs, and symbols whose meanings remain debated by archaeologists.

**Puerco Pueblo** is a partially excavated 100-room pueblo occupied from roughly 1250 to 1380 AD. A short paved trail loops through the ruins, and additional petroglyphs are visible on nearby boulders. Around the summer solstice, a solar marker at the site aligns with a petroglyph — one of several archaeoastronomical features found in the park.

**Painted Desert Inn**, a National Historic Landmark at Kachina Point, was built in the 1920s and renovated by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. It now serves as a museum with murals by Hopi artist Fred Kabotie. The building itself is worth the stop, and the views of the Painted Desert from the terrace are panoramic.

**Route 66 Alignment** passes through the park near the midpoint. A 1932 Studebaker marks the spot where the original Mother Road crossed what is now parkland. It is a subtle monument, but for Route 66 enthusiasts, standing on the old alignment in the middle of the Painted Desert is a powerful moment.

## Where to Stay

There is no lodging inside the park. The nearest town with hotels is **Holbrook**, about 25 miles west on I-40.

**Budget travelers** should check out the Wigwam Motel in Holbrook, one of the last surviving examples of novelty architecture on Route 66. The concrete teepee rooms are basic but clean, starting around $70 a night. For true budget travelers, camping is available at nearby Homolovi State Park for $20–$30 per night, or you can obtain a free backcountry permit to camp in the Painted Desert Wilderness inside the park (no facilities, no water, carry everything in and out).

**Mid-range visitors** will find reliable rooms at the Best Western Arizonian Inn in Holbrook ($80–$110) or the La Posada Hotel in Winslow, 60 miles west, which is one of the finest historic hotels in the Southwest — a restored 1930 Mary Colter-designed Harvey House with rooms from $150 and a superb on-site restaurant.

**Luxury seekers** are best served by staying in Flagstaff or Sedona and making Petrified Forest a day trip. La Posada in Winslow is the most upscale option within reasonable driving distance.

## Where to Eat

Options near the park are limited, so plan accordingly.

**Turquoise Room at La Posada** in Winslow is a destination restaurant in its own right. Chef draws on Southwestern and Native American culinary traditions with dishes like blue corn-crusted trout and Navajo-inspired lamb. Entrees run $18–$35. Worth the 60-mile drive.

**Joe & Aggie's Cafe** in Holbrook has been serving Mexican-American comfort food since 1943. The green chile stew and enchiladas are hearty and reasonably priced at $10–$16. A genuine Route 66 roadside experience.

**Mesa Italiana** in Holbrook is a family-run Italian restaurant with surprisingly good pasta and pizza for a small highway town. Entrees run $12–$22.

**Butterfield Stage Co.** in Holbrook does steaks, burgers, and classic American diner fare. The portions are generous, and breakfast is served all day. Meals run $10–$18.

The park itself has a small cafe at the **Painted Desert Visitor Center** near the north entrance serving sandwiches, snacks, and drinks. Pack a lunch if you want to picnic at one of the covered tables scattered along the park road.

### Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** The park straddles I-40 in eastern Arizona. Enter from the north at I-40 Exit 311 or from the south via US-180. From Flagstaff, it is about 1 hour and 45 minutes east. From Phoenix, plan on 3.5 hours via I-17 and I-40. The park road connects the two entrances, so you can enter one side and exit the other.

**Best Time to Visit:** Spring (March through May) and fall (October through November) bring ideal temperatures in the 50s to 70s and excellent light for photography. Summer can exceed 100 degrees, and winter occasionally brings snow. The park is open daily from 8 AM to 5 PM, with extended hours in summer. There is no overnight camping along the park road.

**Getting Around:** You need a car. The park is a 28-mile linear drive with pullouts and short trails. There is no shuttle service. Fill your gas tank before entering — there are no fuel stations inside the park.

**Money & ATMs:** There are no ATMs inside the park. The nearest ATMs are in Holbrook. The park visitor centers accept credit cards for entrance fees and gift shop purchases. Carry cash for vending machines.

**Safety & Health:** Stay on marked trails — the petrified wood is sharp enough to cut through boots if you slip. Removing petrified wood, rocks, or artifacts from the park is a federal crime with fines up to $500. Even tiny fragments. The park does random vehicle checks at the exit. Bring more water than you think you need. The nearest hospital is Summit Healthcare Regional Medical Center in Show Low, about 80 miles south.

**Packing Essentials:** Bring binoculars for Newspaper Rock, a wide-brim hat, sunscreen, and at least two liters of water per person. A polarizing filter for photography cuts glare on the petrified wood and deepens the sky. Layers are essential — desert temperatures can swing 40 degrees between midday and sunset.

**Local Culture & Etiquette:** The petroglyphs and pueblo ruins in the park are sacred to modern Puebloan communities including the Hopi and Zuni. Treat them with respect — never touch petroglyphs or climb on archaeological structures. If you see other visitors disturbing resources, report it to a ranger. The park's motto is "Take only pictures, leave only footprints."
