I'll be honest — Phoenix wasn't a city that immediately excited me on paper. A massive desert metropolis with wide boulevards and strip malls stretching to the horizon doesn't exactly scream "charming travel destination." But after spending real time here across multiple visits, I've completely changed my tune. Phoenix has a depth and vibrancy that catches you off guard, from its surprisingly excellent food scene to the raw beauty of the Sonoran Desert that presses right up against the city limits.

The fifth-largest city in America is also one of the sunniest, averaging 299 days of sunshine per year. Come during the winter months — when the rest of the country is shivering — and you'll understand why nearly two million snowbirds descend on the Valley of the Sun every year. The temperatures are perfect, the hiking is world-class, and the prices are reasonable compared to other warm-weather winter escapes.

## What Makes Phoenix Special

Phoenix is a desert city that actually embraces its desert identity. Rather than fighting the Sonoran landscape, the best parts of Phoenix lean into it. The Desert Botanical Garden celebrates the staggering diversity of desert plant life. South Mountain Park and Camelback Mountain offer rugged wilderness minutes from downtown. Even the architecture and art scene reflect the colors and forms of the surrounding landscape.

The food scene has exploded in recent years, driven by the city's proximity to Mexico and a growing community of ambitious chefs. The city's Mexican food, in particular, is among the best in the United States — Sonoran-style flour tortillas, green chile, and birria that rivals anything I've had in Sonora itself.

There's also a youthful creative energy centered around downtown and the Roosevelt Row arts district that feels distinctly different from the resort-and-golf culture of nearby Scottsdale. Phoenix is grittier, more diverse, and more interesting than its reputation suggests.

## Things to Do

**Camelback Mountain** is the iconic Phoenix hike. The Echo Canyon Trail on the east side is the most popular route — 1.2 miles to the 2,704-foot summit with 1,280 feet of elevation gain. It's steep, exposed, and involves some rock scrambling, but the 360-degree views of the entire valley from the top are extraordinary. Start before 6 AM in cooler months to avoid crowds; the trail closes when temperatures hit dangerous levels in summer. Free; parking is extremely limited, so arrive early or take a rideshare.

**Desert Botanical Garden** in Papago Park is one of my favorite attractions in Arizona, period. Five themed trails wind through 140 acres showcasing over 50,000 desert plants, including an extraordinary collection of cacti and succulents. The seasonal exhibits — like the spring butterfly pavilion and the winter luminaria nights — are genuinely special. Admission is $25 for adults. Plan about 2-3 hours.

**Heard Museum** in midtown Phoenix is the premier institution for Native American art and culture in the Southwest. The permanent collection spans centuries of work from over 30 tribal nations, and the exhibits on the Indian boarding school era are powerful and important. Admission is $23 for adults. Allow at least 2 hours, more if you're genuinely interested in the subject matter.

**South Mountain Park and Preserve** is one of the largest municipal parks in the country — over 16,000 acres of rugged desert terrain with more than 50 miles of trails. The National Trail is the standout: a challenging 14.3-mile point-to-point route (most people do shorter out-and-back sections). Dobbins Lookout, accessible by car or trail, offers panoramic valley views. Free admission.

**Roosevelt Row (RoRo)** is Phoenix's arts district, roughly centered on Roosevelt Street between 7th Avenue and 16th Street. The First Friday Art Walk (first Friday of every month, 6-10 PM) is when the neighborhood comes alive, with galleries, street musicians, food trucks, and thousands of people. The rest of the month, it's a great area to wander for murals, independent shops, and craft breweries. Free to explore.

**Musical Instrument Museum (MIM)** in north Phoenix houses over 8,000 instruments from 200 countries and territories. You wear wireless headphones as you walk through geographic galleries, hearing the instruments being played. It's genuinely one of the most unique museums I've been to anywhere. Admission is $25 for adults.

**Papago Park** offers easy hiking with distinctive red-rock butte formations. The Hole-in-the-Rock trail is a short, family-friendly hike to a geological formation with views across the park to downtown. The park also contains the Phoenix Zoo and the Desert Botanical Garden. Free admission to the park itself.

## Where to Stay

**The Biltmore** (Arizona Biltmore, a Waldorf Astoria Resort) is Phoenix's grand historic resort, originally designed by Albert Chase McArthur with Frank Lloyd Wright consultation. Rooms start around $300-500 per night in peak winter season. The architecture alone is worth a visit, even if you don't stay — the geometric concrete block design is iconic.

**Found:Re Phoenix** is a boutique art hotel in the Roosevelt Row district with rooms from $150-250 per night. Every room features original artwork, and the on-site Match restaurant serves excellent market-driven cuisine. Walking distance to all the downtown action.

**Graduate Tempe** near Arizona State University offers young, stylish rooms from $120-180. Great location for exploring the Mill Avenue entertainment district and light rail access to downtown Phoenix.

**HI Phoenix - The Metcalf House** is a Hostelling International property in a historic 1907 home near downtown, with dorm beds from $35-45 per night and private rooms from about $80. It's the best budget option in the metro area, with a communal kitchen and friendly atmosphere.

For camping, **Usery Mountain Regional Park** east of Mesa has tent and RV sites from $25-30 per night with stunning Superstition Mountain views.

## Where to Eat

**Barrio Cafe** on 16th Street is chef Silvana Salcido Esparza's flagship, serving elevated Mexican cuisine that's been nationally recognized for over two decades. The chile en nogada and cochinita pibil are phenomenal. Entrees run $18-30. Reservations recommended.

**Tacos Chiwas** in south Phoenix serves some of the best Chihuahuan-style tacos in the state. Their flour tortillas are made fresh, and the carne asada is perfectly charred. Tacos run $3-5 each. Cash only. The line moves fast.

**Pizzeria Bianco** in Heritage Square is regularly cited as one of the best pizza restaurants in America, and after eating there, I don't argue with that assessment. Chris Bianco's wood-fired pies are simple and extraordinary — the Rosa (red onion, Parmigiano, rosemary, Arizona pistachios) is iconic. Pizzas run $16-20. Expect a wait; they don't take reservations for walk-ins.

**The Larder + The Delta** in Uptown Phoenix blends Southern and Southwest cooking. The brunch is outstanding — I always go for the biscuits and gravy or the shrimp and grits. Brunch dishes run $14-22.

**Gallo Blanco** inside the Clarendon Hotel serves everyday Mexican food done really well. Great chilaquiles for breakfast ($12), excellent happy hour margaritas ($8). Casual and consistently good.

**Chino Bandido** is a Phoenix institution serving Chinese-Mexican fusion. A jade chicken plate with Jamaican jerk seasoning over fried rice, served with beans and tortillas — it sounds chaotic but works brilliantly. Plates run $10-14.

## Scott's Pro Tips

**Logistics & Getting There** — Phoenix Sky Harbor (PHX) is extremely well-connected. The PHX Sky Train connects terminals to the Valley Metro Light Rail at 44th Street station for $2, making car rental optional if you're staying in the central corridor. If you're renting a car, I recommend it for accessing trailheads and exploring the wider metro area.

**Best Time to Visit** — November through March is prime season with near-perfect weather in the 65-85°F range. Avoid June through September unless you can handle sustained 110°F-plus temperatures. Hotel rates drop dramatically in summer (half price or better), so if you can tolerate the heat and plan activities for early morning, there are deals to be had.

**Getting Around** — The Valley Metro Light Rail covers 28 miles from 19th Avenue through downtown, Tempe, and east to Mesa. A day pass is $4 and covers most tourist areas. For trailheads and the wider metro, you'll want a car or rideshare. Lyft and Uber are plentiful and affordable here.

**Money & ATMs** — ATMs from Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America are everywhere. Phoenix is a fully modern US city — credit cards accepted everywhere. Budget-wise, Phoenix is more affordable than comparable Sun Belt cities like San Diego or Austin.

**Safety & Health** — Heat is the biggest danger. Carry water everywhere, even on short hikes. The city has seen fatalities on Camelback Mountain from heat exhaustion — don't be cavalier. Hiking trails close when excessive heat warnings are issued. Stay hydrated and avoid outdoor exertion between 10 AM and 4 PM in summer. Major hospitals include Banner University Medical Center Phoenix and St. Joseph's Hospital downtown.

**Packing Essentials** — Sunscreen (SPF 50+), a refillable water bottle, sunglasses, and a hat are absolute necessities year-round. In winter, bring layers for chilly mornings and evenings (40s-50s°F). Comfortable walking shoes for trails and downtown exploring.

**Local Culture & Etiquette** — Phoenix is casual and laid-back. Tipping 18-20% at restaurants is standard. The city is diverse and welcoming. First Friday Art Walk on Roosevelt Row is a community highlight — go at least once. If you're visiting during spring training (February-March), book restaurants early as the city fills up with baseball fans.
