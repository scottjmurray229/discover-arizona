I walked onto Allen Street in Tombstone on a Tuesday afternoon and immediately heard gunshots. Not real ones — a group of actors in period costume were staging a shootout in the middle of the road while tourists gathered on the wooden boardwalks to watch. A stagecoach rolled past. A man in a black duster tipped his hat. For a moment, I genuinely could not tell what century I was in, and that is exactly the point. Tombstone leans hard into its Wild West identity, and while some visitors dismiss it as a tourist trap, I found something more interesting beneath the surface: a real town with a real and remarkably violent history that just happens to have figured out how to monetize it without losing its soul.

## What Makes Tombstone Special

On October 26, 1881, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral lasted approximately 30 seconds and left three men dead. It was one of the most famous shootouts in American history, and it happened right here on a narrow vacant lot in this small mining town. But Tombstone's story goes far deeper than a single gunfight. Founded in 1879 after prospector Ed Schieffelin struck silver in the desert hills (he was told he would only find his own tombstone — hence the name), the town exploded to a population of over 10,000 in just a few years. It had 110 saloons, a bowling alley, an ice cream parlor, and the most notorious entertainment venue between St. Louis and San Francisco — the Bird Cage Theatre.

What makes Tombstone special today is the remarkable preservation of its historic core. Allen Street is closed to automobile traffic and maintained as a living history district. The original 1882 Tombstone Courthouse is now a state park. The Bird Cage Theatre has been left essentially untouched since it closed in 1889, with bullet holes still visible in the walls and ceiling. This is not a recreation or a theme park — these are the actual buildings where these events occurred.

## Things to Do

**O.K. Corral** is the main attraction, and for good reason. The site preserves the actual lot where the Earps and Doc Holliday faced the Clantons and McLaurys. Life-sized figures are positioned where each participant stood. Gunfight reenactments take place daily at 2:00 PM (check the schedule, as additional shows run on busy days). Admission to the corral and reenactment is $12 for adults. The adjacent Historama offers a narrated presentation about the gunfight.

**Boothill Graveyard** sits on the northern edge of town and is free to visit (though a $3 donation is requested). Over 250 people are buried here, many of them meeting violent ends. The headstone inscriptions are grimly entertaining — "Hanged by mistake," "Shot by a friend," and the simple, famous marker for Billy Clanton and the McLaury brothers: "Murdered on the streets of Tombstone." A printed map at the entrance helps you find the notable graves.

**Bird Cage Theatre** is my favorite stop in Tombstone. This combination theater, saloon, gambling hall, and brothel operated 24 hours a day from 1881 to 1889 and hosted acts ranging from opera to burlesque. When silver prices crashed and the mines flooded, the Bird Cage was shuttered with everything inside. It sat untouched for over 50 years before reopening as a museum. The original stage, the "cribs" (private curtained boxes suspended from the ceiling that doubled as rooms for the working women), and 140 bullet holes in the walls and ceiling are all still there. Admission is $15 for adults.

**Tombstone Courthouse State Historic Park** occupies the original 1882 Cochise County Courthouse, a beautiful two-story Victorian brick building. The museum inside chronicles the town's mining history, legal battles, and daily life. A restored courtroom and a recreated gallows in the courtyard round out the exhibits. Admission is $7 for adults.

**Big Nose Kate's Saloon** on Allen Street is the most atmospheric watering hole in town, housed in the 1881 Grand Hotel building. The interior is packed with period artifacts, and live musicians often play country and western tunes. A beer runs $5–$7, and the bartenders will happily share stories about the building's history. It is named for Mary Katherine Horony, Doc Holliday's companion.

**Tombstone Epitaph Museum** preserves the office of Arizona's oldest continuously published newspaper, The Tombstone Epitaph, which has been in print since 1880. The small museum is free and displays original printing equipment and historic editions, including coverage of the O.K. Corral gunfight.

**Tombstone Silver Mine Tour** takes you underground into the Good Enough Mine, one of the original silver mines that built the town. The 45-minute guided tour descends into the mine shaft and covers the geology, mining techniques, and the daily life of 1880s miners. Tours run about $15 per person.

## Where to Stay

**Budget travelers** will find Tombstone affordable by Arizona standards. The Tombstone Monument Ranch, styled as an Old West guest ranch about three miles south of town, has bunkhouse rooms starting around $80. For true budget travelers, Tombstone Territories RV Park offers tent sites starting at $20 per night.

**Mid-range visitors** should consider the Larian Motel on Allen Street, a clean and well-located property with rooms from $85–$110 in a spot where you can walk to everything. The Tombstone Grand Hotel on Allen Street has Western-themed rooms starting around $100.

**Luxury seekers** will find Tombstone's options limited. The nicest rooms in town are at the Tombstone Monument Ranch in their private suites ($150–$200), or you can base yourself in Bisbee (25 miles south) at the Bisbee Grand Hotel or Copper Queen Hotel and day-trip to Tombstone.

## Where to Eat

**Big Nose Kate's Saloon** serves solid bar food alongside its drinks. The burgers and pulled pork sandwiches are decent, and the ambiance makes up for any culinary shortcomings. Meals run $10–$16.

**Crystal Palace Saloon** on Allen Street, originally built in 1879 and rebuilt after fire in 1882, serves steaks, ribs, and standard American fare in a beautifully restored interior with a long mahogany bar. Entrees run $14–$28.

**Longhorn Restaurant** on Allen Street is a Tombstone institution serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The chicken-fried steak is the local favorite, and the prices are reasonable at $10–$18 for entrees.

**Café Margarita** just off Allen Street serves decent Mexican food — the green chile enchiladas and carne asada tacos are my recommendations. Meals run $10–$16.

**O.K. Cafe** near the corral does simple, solid breakfast and lunch — eggs, pancakes, sandwiches — with no pretense and quick service. Meals run $8–$14.

### Scott's Pro Tips

**Getting There:** From Tucson, take I-10 east to AZ-80 south — it is a straight shot of about 70 miles and 1.5 hours. From Phoenix, it is about 3.5 hours via I-10 east. There is no public transit to Tombstone. The town is small enough to explore entirely on foot once you arrive.

**Best Time to Visit:** October through November and March through April offer the most comfortable weather, with daytime highs in the 70s and clear skies. October is also when Tombstone hosts Helldorado Days, a three-day festival with gunfight competitions, a parade, and street entertainment — easily the best time to visit. Summer highs can exceed 100 degrees, which makes walking Allen Street uncomfortable.

**Getting Around:** Tombstone's historic core is compact — roughly four blocks of Allen Street — and entirely walkable. You do not need a car once you are in town. Parking is free on the streets surrounding the historic district.

**Money & ATMs:** There is one ATM at the National Bank of Arizona on Allen Street. Many smaller attractions and shops are cash-only or add a surcharge for credit cards. Bring $50–$100 in cash to be safe.

**Safety & Health:** Tombstone is safe for visitors. The biggest hazard is the sun — Allen Street has wooden boardwalks with some shade, but the side streets and Boothill Graveyard are fully exposed. Stay hydrated. The nearest hospital is Copper Queen Community Hospital in Bisbee, about 25 miles south. For emergencies, call 911.

**Packing Essentials:** Comfortable walking shoes, sunscreen, a hat, and a water bottle. The wooden boardwalks are uneven in places, so skip the flip-flops. A camera with a good zoom lens is useful for the reenactments if you want close-up shots.

**Local Culture & Etiquette:** Tombstone is a working town with about 1,300 residents who take their history seriously. The actors and reenactors are generally happy to pose for photos and answer questions between shows. Tipping the performers after gunfight reenactments is appreciated but not mandatory. Do not remove anything from Boothill Graveyard — the headstones and artifacts are protected. Allen Street is a family-friendly environment despite the gunfight theme.
